# Analog-level-meter-AVR
This is a little project on microcontroller, performed by MIPT students.
The work is done on Atmel atmega328p microcontroller, included in Arduino board. The microcontroller measures the level of analog signal on A0(PC0), 
and shows it on ten-level scale, connected to pins PD3-PD8 and PB0-PB4. The button (PD2) push inverses the signal level.
